Build time fecth is implemented only for OSX at the time.
Linux users are expected to aptitude install vlc-dev (or whichever dev package required).
Windows users have to link manually using appropriate ROXEE_EXTERNAL path.

We do link against libvlc library and headers, which are LGPL.
VLC plugins though, have varied licenses you need to verify before you distribute.

BIG FAT WARNING: no verification is done on the retrieved network archive, and the fetch is done over http.
You really shouldn't use this as a basis to distribute, but rather fetch VLC using your own build system / manually,
then verify the archive, and point ROXEE_EXTERNAL to it.
