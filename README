This is a (very) thin layer on top of libvlc that exposes a uniform scriptable API for it.

It is primarily meant to serve as part of the Roxee runner application, though other people might find interest in it.

There exist at least two other implementations with similar purpose (except scriptability and vlc isolation):
- https://bitbucket.org/trollixx/qtvlc/
- https://github.com/ntadej/vlc-qt/tree/master/src/core


Licensed under LGPL (same as libvlc).
